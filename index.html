        <p class="text">
            The <b>first case of COVID-19</b> was confirmed in New York City (NYC) the 1st of March, the testing begins.
            The USA and NYC have officially entered the beginning of one of the worst crises since the great depression
            in 1929. <br>
            A week later Andrew Cuomo, the governor of NYC, declares a <b>state of emergency</b>. Shortly after a number
            of commuter guidelines, containment zones and lockdowns are issued.
            <br>
            The interactive data <b>visualization journey</b> starts by showing the governmental timeline of NYC and the
            changes in number of new COVID-19 cases each day.
        </p>
        <p class="text"> In the first visualization a number of vertical lines can be observed, each of them indicate an
            <i>important
                event</i> in the timeline of NYC and its fight against COVID-19. By hovering over the vertical lines it
            is
            possible to read about the major events that have unfolded to get a basic overview.
        </p>
        <p class="text"> It is also possible to see the <b>trend</b> of COVID-19 by the plot lines. One can <b>select
            different
            boroughs</b> in NYC in the legend to show the
            number of new positive cases and also the total amount of new performed tests in NYC. To the right in the
            corner a number of tools can be observed,
            these can be used to zoom or enable you to hover the different plot lines to show values of the point you
            hover over. Feel free to play around.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-center mt-0">The Observations</h3>
        <p class="text">
            The <i>observant reader</i> can see there are differences in the number of positive cases for <b>each
            borough</b>.
            The <b>Bronx</b> seems have the <b>highest</b> number of positive cases, while <b>Manhattan</b> is far <b>lower</b>
            than the other boroughs. <br>
            One important thing to point out is the April 14th, a spike is clearly visible, likely linked to a change in
            how
            the number of deaths is reported (more on this event here:
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-deaths.html">N.Y.C.
                Death Toll Soars Past 10,000 in Revised Virus Count</a>) <br>
            Correlation can also be observed between the boroughs, as the trend and peaks follow each other. Potential
            factors that could explain the differences is the aim of the analysis.

                    Many have attempted to pinpoint a scapegoat for the infection rate of the virus.
                    In the beginning it was said that only the <i>elderly</i> would get seriously ill.
                    Later on it became apparent that <i>people of all ages</i> were in danger of losing their health and
                    even their lives to the pandemic.<br>
                <p class="text"> So what is it?

                <p class="text"> Is it the age, the ethnicity or are the poor the ones really in danger?</p>
                <p class="text">
                    From plot below, the <b>proportions of ethnic groups per borough</b> is displayed . The <b>Bronx</b>
                    has
                    substantially large number of people belonging to the <b>hispanic, latino and african american</b>
                    communities.
                    <b>Statten Islands'</b> population is, instead, <b>more than 50% white</b>.

                    To explore the 4 plots right above, we first need to understand the concept of the <b>boxplot</b>:
                    <i>“A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five number
                        summary (“minimum”, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and “maximum”). It can
                        tell
                        you about your outliers and what their values are. It can also tell you if your data is
                        symmetrical,
                        how tightly your data is grouped, and if and how your data is skewed.”</i> <a

                    information for the curious user.</a>
                </p>
                <p class="text"> We can now quickly appreciate the <b>distribution</b> of income, medical spending
                    and median age of each ethnic group in the city as well as showing the poverty rate per ethnic group
                    in each borough.<br>
                    It appears that the <b>white</b> population is the <i>richest</i> and the <i>oldest</i>.<br>
                    The <b>hispanics</b> have the <i>lowest income</i>, <i>spend the least on medical care</i> and are
                    also the <i>youngest</i>.
                    If you live in the <b>Bronx or Brooklyn</b> you are more likely to be <i>poor</i> than if you live
                    in the other
                    boroughs of NYC.

                    What does this indicate for the spread of the Coronavirus in New York City? Does it give us a clear
                    indication of which are the underlying factors that lead to some socioeconomic groups being hit
                    hardest by the Coronavirus?
                    It is safe to say that there is room for further exploration of demographic and the link to
                    COVID-19.

                    What follows are two elements that are to be used in unison both can also be used separately. <br>
                    The map displays the <b>geographical distribution of the statistical indicators</b> that are
                    available for
                    selection from the <b>menu</b> to its <b>bottom right</b>. The subdivision shown is the <b>ZIP Code
                    Tabulation Areas</b>
                    (<b>ZCTAs</b>), which are a standard subdivision of the territory in the USA, which is also used by
                    the
                    Census Bureau (<a
                        href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html"
                        target="_blank">more information for the curious</a>).<br>
                    Below the map is a <b>scatter plot</b>. It shows the total number of COVID-19 in the
                    various areas against the statistic that is chosen from the menu to the top right of this plot. It
                    is the same selection menu, which control both plots. The <b>size of the balls</b> is linearly
                    dependent to
                    the <b>population</b> of that area. Bigger size of the balls equals bigger population living in that
                    area.<br>
                    The two plots interact because you can <b>click</b> on the <b>areas</b> in the map and have the
                    respective ball
                    <b>highlighted</b> in the correlation plot. If a certain color stands out or you are interested in
                    the
                    numbers for a specific area, just click on the area, or select more then one by clicking on more.
                    You can always reset the selection by clicking outsize any area or by selection another statistic.

        <p class="text">
            Follows a brief description of the statistics available:
        </p>

        <ul class="mylist">
            <li><b>Commuters using public transportation</b>. This is the number of workers who use public
                transportation to get to
                work. This gives us insight into the utilization of public transportation. It is a factor that is tied
                to
                the location, as this will be higher for places where use of public transportation is a must, such as
                the
                heart of Manhattan.
            </li>
            <li><b>Per-capita income</b>. This is the income per-capita in each ZCTA. Important to understand how rich
                an area is
                on average.
            </li>
            <li><b>Education Index</b>. Measures the average education level of an area, higher means on average more
                people have a higher education.
            </li>
            <li><b>Median Age (years)</b>. The median age, in years, of the ZCTA.</li>
            <li><b>Ratio of female inhabitants</b>. The proportion of female inhabitants living in that area. We only
                show female
                ratio because the male ratio is complementary.
            </li>
            <li><b>Total population</b>. Total number of people that live in the ZCTA.</li>
            <li><b>White people (every thousand), African American people (every thousand), Hispanic or Latino (every
                thousand), Asian people (every thousand)</b>. Number of people with that ethnicity every thousand living
                in that
                area.
            </li>
            <li><b>Number of positives</b>. Number of positive cases to COVID-19.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
            We can now freely explore the correlations between these factors and the number of cases. The first thing to
            note is just by looking at the <b>total population</b>. There is no strong correlation between the size of
            an area
            and the number of cases. This means that if the overcrowding is an issue, it doesn't come from having a high
            number of people living in the same area.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            We then want to focus on the education index
        </p>
